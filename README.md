# Automatic Number Plate Recognition

This repository contains a project focused on Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using various computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Repository Overview

- **Main File**: `Number-Plate.ipynb`
- **Primary Language**: Jupyter Notebook

## Features

The Jupyter Notebook `Number-Plate.ipynb` includes the following features:
1. **Import Libraries**: The notebook starts by importing essential libraries such as `cv2`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `easyocr`, and `imutils`.
2. **Load and Preprocess Image**: The notebook demonstrates loading an image and converting it to grayscale for further processing.
3. **Number Plate Detection**: Using various image processing techniques, the notebook identifies and extracts the number plate region from the image.
4. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: The extracted number plate is then processed using OCR to read the characters on the plate.

## Repository Structure

- `Number-Plate.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the ANPR implementation.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the packages from `requirements.txt`
3. Open `Number-Plate.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to see the ANPR process in action.
